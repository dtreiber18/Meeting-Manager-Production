# Fathom Webhook Integration - Troubleshooting Guide

## üéØ Issue Discovered & Fixed

### Problem
Your Fathom webhooks were being **rejected with 401 Unauthorized** errors.

### Root Cause
**Header name case mismatch:**
- Fathom (via Svix) sends: `Webhook-Signature` (capitalized)
- Your code was expecting: `webhook-signature` (lowercase)
- Spring Boot's `@RequestHeader` is case-sensitive

### Evidence
From ngrok request logs, we found **multiple webhook attempts from Fathom**:
```
User-Agent: Svix-Webhooks/1.77.0
Webhook-Signature: v1,bN2dLyJJff95POm4+ybbcrseBOgd/v3pGU1xF1+l35M=
Content-Length: 202546 (200KB+ of meeting data!)
Status: 401 Unauthorized
```

### Solution Applied
‚úÖ Fixed `FathomWebhookController.java` line 51:
```java
// Before:
@RequestHeader(value = "webhook-signature", required = false) String signature

// After:
@RequestHeader(value = "Webhook-Signature", required = false) String signature
```

## ‚úÖ Verification Tests

### Test 1: Manual Webhook Test
We successfully tested the webhook endpoint with a simulated Fathom payload:

```bash
python3 test-fathom-webhook.py
```

**Result:** ‚úÖ SUCCESS
- Webhook received and validated
- Meeting created in database (ID: 11)
- Appears in API response

### Test 2: Endpoint Accessibility
```bash
curl https://20a1eda6fe21.ngrok-free.app/api/webhooks/fathom/health
```

**Result:** ‚úÖ SUCCESS
```json
{
  "status": "healthy",
  "service": "fathom-webhook",
  "message": "Fathom webhook endpoint is active",
  "version": "1.0"
}
```

## üîÑ What Happens Next

### Automatic Retry
Fathom (via Svix) automatically retries failed webhooks using an **exponential backoff strategy**:
- First retry: ~1 minute
- Second retry: ~5 minutes
- Third retry: ~15 minutes
- Continues for up to 3 days

**With the fix deployed, the next retry should succeed!**

### New Meetings
Any new Fathom recordings from now on will be delivered successfully.

## üìä How to Monitor Webhook Delivery

### Option 1: ngrok Web Inspector
Open http://localhost:4040 in your browser to see:
- All incoming webhook requests
- Request/response details
- Payload contents
- Success/failure status

### Option 2: Backend Logs
Watch the backend logs for Fathom webhook processing:
```bash
# Watch backend output
tail -f backend.log | grep -i fathom

# Or check running process logs
# (backend is running in background)
```

Look for these log messages:
```
‚úÖ SUCCESS:
INFO  c.g.m.c.FathomWebhookController - Received Fathom webhook ID: xxx
INFO  c.g.m.c.FathomWebhookController - Fathom webhook signature verified
INFO  c.g.m.service.FathomWebhookService - Created meeting with ID: xxx

‚ùå FAILURE:
WARN  c.g.m.c.FathomWebhookController - Fathom webhook received without signature
ERROR c.g.m.c.FathomWebhookController - Invalid Fathom webhook signature
```

### Option 3: Database
Check for new meetings from Fathom:
```bash
mysql -u${DB_USERNAME} -p${DB_PASSWORD} -D meeting_manager -e \
  "SELECT id, title, source, fathom_recording_id, created_at
   FROM meetings
   WHERE source = 'FATHOM'
   ORDER BY created_at DESC
   LIMIT 10;"
```

### Option 4: Application UI
Refresh your browser at http://localhost:4200 to see new meetings appear!

## üîß Forcing Fathom to Resend a Webhook

Unfortunately, Fathom doesn't provide a "Resend Webhook" button in their UI. You have these options:

### Option 1: Wait for Automatic Retry
The failed webhooks will automatically retry within minutes.

### Option 2: Re-save Webhook Configuration
1. Go to Fathom Settings ‚Üí Webhooks
2. Click "Edit" on your webhook
3. Make a small change (e.g., toggle a scope off and back on)
4. Click "Save"
5. This may trigger a test webhook

### Option 3: Create a Test Recording
1. Start a quick Fathom recording (even just 30 seconds)
2. End the recording
3. Wait for Fathom to process it
4. Webhook will be sent automatically

### Option 4: Contact Fathom Support
Ask them to manually trigger a webhook resend for your account.

## üö® Troubleshooting

### Issue: ngrok URL Changed
If you restart ngrok, the public URL will change. You'll need to:
1. Get new URL: `curl -s http://localhost:4040/api/tunnels | python3 -c "import sys, json; print(json.load(sys.stdin)['tunnels'][0]['public_url'])"`
2. Update Fathom webhook settings with new URL

### Issue: Still Getting 401 Errors
Check that:
- Backend has been restarted with the fix
- Environment variable `FATHOM_WEBHOOK_SECRET` matches Fathom's secret
- The webhook URL in Fathom exactly matches your ngrok URL

### Issue: Webhooks Received but Meetings Not Created
Check backend logs for processing errors:
```bash
tail -f backend.log | grep -i "error\|exception"
```

### Issue: Meetings Created but Not Showing in UI
1. Check the API directly: `curl http://localhost:8080/api/meetings | grep -i fathom`
2. Clear browser cache and refresh
3. Check browser console for JavaScript errors
